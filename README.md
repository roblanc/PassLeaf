PassLeaf is a minimalistic password generator that helps you create strong, random passwords through a clean and intuitive interface. The page now sports a modern gradient background with subtle dots. Headings use the arcade-inspired **Press Start 2P** font, while the rest of the interface is set in **Poppins** for readability. A **Copy** button lets you quickly place the generated password on your clipboard.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your browser to use the generator. If you prefer a local server, run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
